# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  lack of error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the example shows a route that fetches a user by ID.  The code attempts to parse the ID as an integer without proper error checking. If the request's ID parameter is not an integer or is not a valid user ID, the application might crash or return unexpected behavior.  The solution shows how to add input validation and robust error handling to improve the application's reliability and security.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file demonstrates the problematic code where it attempts to parse the user ID without checking for validity, leading to potential errors.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution that incorporates error handling using `isNaN` to prevent potential errors.  This improved solution gracefully handles non-numeric IDs and missing users, returning appropriate HTTP status codes.
